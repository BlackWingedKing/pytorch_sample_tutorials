some tutorials by me for teaching pytorch

### What is Pytorch
[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a framework for rapid development and deployment of Machine learning algorithms. It is inspired from the [torch](http://torch.ch/) which is built on lua. Pytorch is a python wrapper for a library built on C++ and CUDA. 
### Installation and environment setup
- for linux users just go [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install according to your system requirements
- for windows users first install anaconda (It's preffered to use this pip also works too) by following this tutorial [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows) and then from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) get the conda command and run it in anaconda prompt
