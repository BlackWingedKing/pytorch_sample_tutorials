# pytorch_sample_tutorials
some tutorials by me - teaching pytorch to [pravinraut](https://github.com/pravinraut)
#### WIP - This repository and readme will be updated as my classes with my friend continue 
### What is Pytorch
[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a framework for rapid development and deployment of Machine learning algorithms. It is inspired from the [torch](http://torch.ch/) which is built on lua. Pytorch is a python wrapper for a library built on C++ and CUDA. 
### Installation and environment setup
- for linux users just go [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install according to your system requirements
- for windows users first install anaconda (It's preffered to use this, pip also works too) by following this tutorial [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows) and then from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) get the conda command and run it in anaconda prompt
- [VSCode Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is preferred. Also install useful extensions and enable pylinting
### Basic tutorials and flow
The best source for learning pytorch is the official [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- Completed the 60 min blitz
- 03/08/2020 - the code simple_network.py generates random data using numpy and trains a classifier over it
